your_image_name:latest	The name of the Docker image you are building, along with the tag (latest is common for the most recent version). This name will be used when pushing/pulling images.	yourusername/myproject:latest
ssh user@your_server	The SSH command to connect to your server where Docker is running. Replace user with your actual username and your_server with the server's IP address or hostname.	ssh deployuser@192.168.1.100
secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD	The GitHub secret that contains your Docker Hub password, used for authentication when pushing/pulling images. You should add this to your GitHub Secrets.	${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME	The GitHub secret that contains your Docker Hub username. This is used for authentication in your workflow. You should also add this to your GitHub Secrets.	${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
Detailed Explanation of Each Value:
your_dockerhub_username:

Explanation: This is your unique username on Docker Hub. It identifies your account and is part of the image name when you push your images.
Example: If your Docker Hub account is johnsmith, then this value would be johnsmith.
your_image_name:latest:

Explanation: This is how you tag your Docker image. The latest tag signifies the most recent version of the image. You can replace latest with any version name you prefer.
Example: If your project is named myproject, the image name could be johnsmith/myproject:latest.
ssh user@your_server:

Explanation: This command is used to connect to your remote server via SSH, which is necessary if you want to deploy your application on a server.
Example: If your username is deployuser and your server's IP is 192.168.1.100, you would use ssh deployuser@192.168.1.100.
secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD:

Explanation: This secret contains your Docker Hub password, which is used to authenticate your Docker operations (like pushing images) in the GitHub Actions workflow.
Example: You would set this in GitHub Secrets with the name DOCKER_PASSWORD.
secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME:

Explanation: This secret contains your Docker Hub username, which is also necessary for authentication in your GitHub Actions workflow.
Example: You would set this in GitHub Secrets with the name DOCKER_USERNAME.
Setting Up GitHub Secrets
To add these secrets in GitHub:

Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click on "Settings."
Select "Secrets and variables" > "Actions."
Click "New repository secret" to create DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD.

Adding these secrets will allow your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate with Docker Hub and push your images successfully.

Conclusion
By setting up your GitHub Actions workflow with the necessary values and secrets, you can automate the deployment of your Docker images to your server. This process streamlines your development workflow and ensures that your application is always up-to-date and running smoothly.
